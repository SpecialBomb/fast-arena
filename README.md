# Fast Arena!
Fast Arena is a casual CA style gametype for the game WarFork meant to balance team size and round speed for larger lobbies of players.

The goal is to either eliminate the other team or have more total health on your team by match timeout. The same rules apply from Clan Arena with some modifications: Games are best 2 out of 3, match time is ideally 4 minutes maximum, and the losing team is re-selected from the player queue on match end.

## Question: Why do this? CA is already fun!

CA is very fun! I, however, think that CA can get really messy when there are more than 4 players on each team, which happens very often in public lobbies. A lot of the best CA maps in WarFork keep in mind a team size of about 3, and as a result the game gets incredibly busy and hard to keep up with for most players, and the design decisions from mappers are thrown out the window; it feels like a different and subjectively worse experience.


The point of Fast Arena is to limit the team sizes so that game balance feels more even and enjoyable, while also creating a fast gameplay cycle that motivates people to stay in the game queue for their turn to play. This is helped by randomly selecting a new team every time a team loses, and limiting the match length to be shorter.


I also notice some players that focus on movement like to sometimes stall in CA if they are among the last on the team, which is usually fruitless as someone usually ends up killing them after a minute or two of speeding across the map, or it results in a draw if the teams are even. Movement takes a lot of skill, and I find this impressive! I personally think this behavior should be rewarded in a casual environment, as it's more inclusive to players that like race gamemodes or simply play WarFork for its incredible movement. To allow for this, I made it so that total team HP is the main factor for which team wins at the end of a match, and by limiting the match time. Doing this allows movement players to likely time out the clock and win for their team if they can keep their HP high the entire match.
